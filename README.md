Coordinator Pattern + MVVM experiment, with storyboards.

## Description:

The purpose of the project is simply to demonstrate (and learn) how to implement the coordinator pattern in a new iOS project. 

"A Coordinator is an object the encapsulates a lifecycle that is spread over a collection of view controllers. "So what is a coordinator? A coordinator is an object that bosses one or more view controllers around. Taking all of the driving logic out of your view controllers, and moving that stuff one layer up is gonna make your life a lot more awesome" 

-- Soroush Khanlou

## Why use the Coordinator pattern? <a name="why"></a>

#### Benefits: <a name="benefits"></a>

- Clear navigation
- Separation of concerns
- Smaller View Controllers
- Unchained module-to-module responsibility / Isolation
- Modules completely independent from one another
- Every task and sub-task has a dedicated way of being encapsulated
- Reusable ViewControllers / Modules
- Controllers can be easily integrated into different flows
- Coordinators separate display-binding from side effects
- Simplified testing

#### Normally ViewControllers are tasked with: <a name="currentModel"></a>

- Model-View Binding
- Subview Allocation
- Data Fetching
- Layout
- Data Transformation
- Navigation Flow
- User Input
- Model Mutation

## Interaction with ViewControllers: <a name="interaction"></a>

- Delegate Pattern
- Callbacks

## What is a Module? <a name="module"></a>

For MVC, a module is a controller and, for Viper, an Interactor-Presenter-View.

#### They should be:

- Composable: they should be components where the sum of them become the modules. The modules can then be built internally, and have their own consistency.

- Blackboxed: should expose a clear API thatâ€™s strategical, moreover, it should be completely reusable outside of any predefined architecture.

- Testable: should be easy to test.

## Architecture

MVVM concepts + Coordinator pattern:

- Coordinator - instantiates view controllers, injects dependencies
- Router - pushes views to a Navigation Controller
